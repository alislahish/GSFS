These are some basic JavaScript functions for calculating
  + [Metallic means](http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/spinadel/index.html) `Array` sequences, 
  + [Metallic ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_mean) as `numbers`, and 
  + Logarithmic spirals of the form __r = a + e^(b * theta)__ as `Objects`.
