# GSFS - Generalized Secondary Fibonacci Sequences

These are some basic JavaScript functions for calculating
  + [Metallic means](http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/spinadel/index.html) as `Array` values, 
  + [Metallic ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_mean) as `number` values, and 
  + [Logarithmic spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral) of the form __r = a * e^(b * theta)__ as `Object` values.
    
These functions were neither optimized for any specific purpose nor tested beyond basic visual checks.
